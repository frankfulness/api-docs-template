# Introduction

[Valiant](https://github.com/frankfulness/qr) is a URL -> QR Code meant to be easy to use. Valiant QR
is written in Python (with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)) and
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as frontend using AWS S3 bucket and qr module.

## Overview of features

It has the following features:

- Allows you to type or paste in a URL and generate a QR code for it.

## Why does this exist?

There are plenty of QR generators. So why does Valiant QR exist?

**Firstly**, it is **complete, simple, and a nice asthetic**

**Secondly**, there is a **lack of CICD DevOps work so I wanted to create a full stack app for it**. pretty straight forward.

**Finally**, I developed this project to learn more about Next.js and apply my Python (e.g. FastAPI)
experience to a project with a real purpose.
